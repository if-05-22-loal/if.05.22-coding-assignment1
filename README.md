# Assignment 1: Coding Assignment

## Objective
This week's assignment is to get you familiar with Java, repeat recursion and easy algorithmic stuff.

## Materials
- Java IDE you use in the Java class.

## Required Tasks
1. Write a Java program that calculates the gcd by calculating the the product of the common prime factors
2. Write a Java program that calculates the gcd by using the Euclidean algorithm using the mod operator as presented in class
3. Implement a main method which calls your methods with test data. Test thoroughly.
## Evaluation
Most common reasons to mark down a solution would be
- One or more of the *Required Tasks* section are not satisfied
- Submitted code is visually sloppy and hard to read
- The code presentation shows severe difficulties in understanding your own code
